`MethodFallback` offers an easy way of delegating to another method if the
original one returned nil.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'method_fallback'
```

And then execute:

```sh
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```sh
$ gem install method_fallback
```

## Usage

```ruby
class Author
  def name
    'John Doe'
  end
end

class Article
  def author
    Author.new
  end

  def author_name
    nil
  end

  fallback author_name: :name, to: :author
end

article = Artile.new

article.author_name_without_fallback # => nil
article.author_name # => "Jane Doe"
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
